Github for Beginners:

Git is a Version Control System (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files

Typically, you have a local repository that you work on, and you upload(push) your changes to a remote repository(GitHub)

GIT:
-Keeps track of code history
-Takes "snapshots" of your files(commit)
-You can visit any snapshot any time
-You can stage files before commiting(add)

Basic Commands:

git init             initializes local git repository(creates .git folder)

git add <file>       adds file/s to index. add . will add all files 

git status           check status of working tree

git commit           commits changes in index. commit -m "comment" skips vim

git push			 pushes to remote repository

git pull             pulls latest from remote repository

git clone            clones remote repository to your local one

git branch <name of branch>  creates new branch

git checkout <name of branch> switches to that branch

git merge <name of branch> merges branch


Extra things:
creating a .gitignore file, and including the files you don't want to include will cause git to not add these files to your repository


Connecting to a remote repository:

Go to github.com and create new repository. Follow instructions
